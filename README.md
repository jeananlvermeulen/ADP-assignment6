The program I’m creating is for a courier service. This application allows you to track your package status once you’ve ordered them. It also allows the user to pay the courier service for the delivery of the package once the package has been delivered. Payments can be made via cash, EFT or cheque.
The application will prompt the user with a login screen where the user will enter his or her details if they are existing members of the application. If the users are new to the application they will be able to register to use the application. A forgot username or password feature will also be available for users that forgot either their username or password. 
Once the user have created an account or logged in to the application they can track the package they have ordered through the barcode of the package that they have ordered. The application will then tell the user if their package is in transit or not. The application will also let the user know the last known location of the package for example Cape Town International Customs.  Once the user is done with the application he/she will be able to logout.
